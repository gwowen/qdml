This is QDML, the quick and dirty math library. I created it for taking care of
matrices with personal OpenGL projects, and it's worked so far. It's quick, it's
dirty (I really need to go back and refactors)... and it's a math library, hence
QDML.

Probably I'm going to refactor, implement the functions I haven't yet, and split
it up... and also write up a better README.
